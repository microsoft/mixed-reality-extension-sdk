# Mixed Reality Extension SDK Contribution Guide

Want to help out? Great! Here are a couple of ways to help:

## Build Something Cool
If you make something with this SDK, tell us about it. We'd love to hear your 
experience, both the good and the bad.


## Give Feedback
Submit bugs and feature requests on the [issues page](
https://github.com/microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk/issues) and help us
verify fixes.


## Contribute Code
Submit [pull requests](
https://github.com/Microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk/pulls) for bug fixes
and features.


## Learning TypeScript
If you already know JavaScript, TypeScript is quick to get started with. 
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing. Here is a [5
minute tour of TypeScript](
http://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html).


## Where to start
Not sure what to implement? There are a number of [issues labeled Help Wanted](
https://github.com/microsoft/mixed-reality-extension-sdk/labels/help%20wanted)
that could all be good starting points.

Other areas could be to create additional functional tests and samples, and to
comment on the documentation. 

This repository only contains the server side of the SDK, so any protocol 
changes have to be coordinated with the AltspaceVR client development team.


## Tips to create good pull requests
Before accepting pull requests, we run all functional tests within the host 
app.
* Clear description
* Single issue per pull request


## Coding guidelines
* Run TS-Lint to be clean
* If using Visual Studio Code, use the auto-formatter (alt+shift+f)
* add copyright header to new files
